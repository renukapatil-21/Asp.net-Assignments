# ADO.NET

- High-Speed Data Access Technology for Microsoft .NET Apps
- The 'System.Data', the Assembly (a Package) for Data Access Object Model
    - The 'System.Data.SqlClient', a Package for SQL Server
- Various Classes
    - SqlConnection
        - Used to Manage teh Database Connection
        - Open(), OpenAsync(), methdos to Open Connection With Database
        - Close(), CloseAsync(), methods to Close Database Connection
        - ConnectionString property, that accepts Connection String as input
            - Examples of Connection String
            - Case 1: Using Windows Admin user to connect to Database
                - Data Source=[SERVER-NAME];Initial Catalog=[DATABASE-NAME];Integrated Security=SSPI
                    - SERVER-NAME: The Name of the MAchine where the SQL Server Instance is Running
                        - localhost (if using local machine) OR IP ADDRESS OR . (if using the Local Machine)
                - e.g.
                    - Data Source=.;Initial Catalog=Companyl;Integrated Security=SSPI;
            - Case 2: Using SQL Server Authentication
                - Data Source=[SERVER-NAME];Initial Catalog=[DATABASE-NAME];User Id=[SQL-SERVER-USER-ID];Password=[Password];
                - e.g.
                    - Data Source=.;Initial Catalog=Company;User Id=sa;Password=Pass@word;
            - Follow the SWebSite
                - https://www.connectionstrings.com/microsoft-data-sqlclient/
                
    - SqlCommand 
        - Used to Perform DB Transactions (Read/Write) Operations with Database over the Connection
        - The 'Connection' property, this accepts the Connection object to Database over which the Read/Write Operations are performed
        - CommandType
            - Property that represents the Type of Statement to be executed on the Database Server
            - CommandType.Text, accepts a string which contains Query e.g. Select, Insert, Update, and Delete
            - CommandType.StoredProcedute, accept the Stored Procedure name
                - CommandText="Stored-Procedure-Name"
        - Execute Methods
            - ExecuteReader(), ExecuteReaderAsync()
                - Returns an Instance of 'SqlDataReader' class when the CommandText is 'Select' Statement
                - SqlDataReader: The Read-Only-Forward-Only Cursor, that reads data from First Record and Move to next till last record
                    - The 'Read()' method to start reading
                    - The 'Close()' method to CLose the Reader
            - ExecuteNonQuery(), ExecuteNotQueryAsync()
                - USed when the ComamndText is DML Statement (Insert, Update and Delete)
                - This method will return a 'Non-Zero' number that represents no. of records affected
            - ExecuteScalar(), ExecuteScalarAsync()
                - Used when the Select Query returns a Single Value e.g. Min, Max, Average, etc.
                - We can use while working with Stored Procs
    - SqlParameter
        - The class that represent the Parameter passed to

        - Pass connection object to the Connection Property of Command class
        - Set the CommandType for The Command Instance as Text or Stored Procedure
        - Set the CommandText property of the Command Instance as either Query or Stored Procedure name dependning on the CommandType
        - Invoke an Execute Method based on CommandText
        - If the SqlDataReader as return from Command's execute method then use 'Read()' method to read data and then 'Close()' reader
        - If the DML Operations then cehck for Non-Zero value from the Execute method of Command object
        - Close() the connection
- Practices for Building Data Access Layer with ADO.NET
    - Create a Generic Interface that will be containing declarations for methods commonly used for CRUD Operations
    - Define Separate Layers (.dll) files for Entity Classes, DAL, and Interface Contract

# ASP.NET Core 6 As a Technology
1. Depedency Injection
    - Managed using 'IServiceCollection' interface
        - This will be used to Register External Dependencies in DI Container of WebApplicationBuilder 
    - The 'ServiceDescrioptor' class is used to provode the Dependency Container with Following Methods
            - AddScoped()
                - The Object will be live for the Current Requested Session (Log-In), and this obejct will be destroyed, when the session is over or closed (Log-Out)
                - The Object will be available across all HTTP Requests under that current Session
                - Recommended in case of Razor Views Apps (Web App) and MVC Apps
                - Statefull
                    - Maintain the state of the object across all requests for an active session
                - Generally Following Objects are Scopped
                    - Database Access Objects
                    - Objects for Session Based Logging
                    - Identity Objects (aka Security)
            - AddSingleton()
                - The Object will be live throughout the life of the Application
                - It will be created once and will be destroyed only when the Application is Unloded from the web server or Crashed
                - One object will be shared across all Sessions
                - Application Level Logging Objects MUST be Sigleton
                - Global State or Shared object across all sessions
            - AddTransient()
                - The Object will be live only for the request
                - This will be killed once the request is over
                - Use this carefully for all suces object those are lightweight or does not have any heavyload dependencies
                - Stateless
                    - Really Loightweight
                - E.g.
                    - A In-Memeory Collection that is sued only for a specific request

- MVC Controllers
    - They are Objects those are responsible to Accept HTTP Requests and Process them
    - HTTP GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE
    - Based on requests the 'Action Method (?)' will be executed and the Model will be updated and the View will be returned
        - Action Method: A Method from a controller class that is Mapped with HTTP Request
            - This action method performs following
                  - Accept the Data Posted by the client in Request using Http Post and Put request
                  - Validates the Data (Provided the Validation Rukes are applied)
                  - Call the Business Logic from Models
                  - Handle the Exception if the Logical Error Occured and then Response the Error Page
                  - If The Method is Successfull then Returns a View or Redirect to other Action Method from Same Controller or redirect to action method of Different Controller
            - Action Method returna a Common COntract named 'IActionResult'
                - The IActionResult can be
                    - ViewResult: Returns a View
                    - RedirectToActionREsult: Return to Action method of same controller ot Different Controller
                    - JsonResult: Returns JSON
                    - OKResult: Returns OK() as a Stastus (API Reponses)
                    - OkObjectResult: Return HTTP Status Code with Data as JSON (API Reponses)
                    - NotFound, NoContent, etc. (API Reponses)
            - All Action Methods are HttpGet by default, to use them for Http Post / Http Put / Http Delete, we need to apply the [HttpPost] attribute, [HttpPut], [HttpDelete]

    - The 'Controller' is a Base class for MVC Controller and this class has following
        - Having its base class as 'ControllerBase'
            - Common Base for MVC COntroller and ApiController
            - Properties for
                - HTTP Request and Response
                - Valdating Models Received using HTTP POST and POST Requests
                - 
        - Contains method for
            - Returning View as a reponse
                - Page View
                - Partial View
            - Returning JSON as a Response
            - Action Execution
        - Properties
            - ViewData
                - Pass data from Controller to View Other Than Model
                - Of the Type ViewDataDictionary 
            - TempData
                - Pass Data Across Controllers
            - ViewBag
                - A Dynamic Object that will be Casted to 'ViewDataDictionary'
- Process for Adding View
     - If using Visual Studio 2022 on WIndows, the Right-Click on Action Method and select Add view
            - In VS 2022 on Window, the Add View Scaffolder WIndow will be shown which will take the View Name as the name of the Action Method in whichw we have Right-CLicked to add View. For thios window Select View Template(?) and The select the Model class
            - View Template, ready to scaffold templates to show UI
                - List
                    - For Index() action method
                    - LIst ot IEnumerable of Model class to show data in List (or HTML Table)
                - Create
                    - Accepts an EMoty Model class to create a View with TextBoxes to add da a values to create new record
                - Edit
                    - Accepts a Model class that is to be Updated
                - Delete
                    - Acccpets a Mdoel class which is to be deleted 
                - Details
                    - Accepts a Model class which is ReadOnly
                - Empty
                    - Provides facility to developers to create views as per their needs
                - Empty Without Model
                    - EMpty for HTML and JavaScript 
     - If using Vidsual Studio 2022 for Mac OR Visual Studio Code, then Create a Folder in the Views folder with Same name as Name of the Controller for which the Views are added and then add views in this folder
- @model IEnumerable<Department>
     - This indicates the type if data that is passed to View

- RazorPage<TModel>, the base class for Razor View in ASP.NET Core MVC
     - Properties
          - Model
                - The model Data passed to View using @model directive
                - The model Data passed to View while scaffolding (VS 2022 on WIndows)
                - Using this Model propwrty, properties of model classed passed to the View can be access on the View for 'Model Binding'
                - The 'Html' is a property of View Base class tthat is used to access HTML Helper Methods on View to Generate HTML Output
    - Tag Helpers
          - Lightweight attribute classes those are applied on HTML elements to define its behavior
          - They are classes those are used to help HTML standard elements to Show Data, Accept data, and generate HTML Dynamically
          - e.g.
               - asp-for: Applied on HTML input:text elememt so that it can accept data from end-user
               - asp-controller: applied on Anchro tag 'a' to navigate to the controller
               - asp-action: To navigate to action method of the controller, applied on Anchor tag
               - asp-items: Accept the IEnumerable<T> as input parameter to generate HTML Dynamically
               - ...and many more
```` html
    <input type="text" asp-for="Model.DeptNo"/>
````
    - Show and accept DeptNo

# MVC Programming Object Model

1. Handling Model Validations in POST Request
    - System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotation.dll
        - Assembly that contains 'ValidationAttribute' abstract class
            - This class has a 'IsValid()' method which is overriden for writing Validation Logic for Model Properties
        - THis is ised to define Model Class Propeties Validation Classes
            - RequiredAttribute
            - ComparerAttribute
            - StringLengthAttribute,
            - ... various other attribute classes
    - If the Entities are in seperate dll file, then add System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotation package in it to use validation classes
    - Use the 'ModelState' property of ControllerBase class to validated the Posted model as folows
```` csharp
    if(ModelState.IsValid){.....}
````
    - We can also add a custom Vadlition attribute by deriving the class from 'ValidationAttribute' class and overriding an 'IsValid()' method
        - NOTE: For Custom Validators the Page will be posted back to the server
    - The Entity class for Validations can be changed using ValidationAttribute if the sourece code access is available, other it is better to write a custom Validator
2. Customization of View by passing data to it other than Model Properties data
    - Use ViewData or ViewBag to pass such additional data
    - Please Note ****
        - If a View is accepting a ViewBag or ViewData, then all Action Methods returning to that view MUST pass the VeiwBag or ViewData otherwise the View will crash
    - Since a View can accept only one Model object, to pass the data in the form ParentChild models, use one of the following
        - Use ViewBag and pass data to View
            - If passing the List of Parent Model preeprties to the Child view and wants to show it in the DropDoenList or HTML select element, then use the 'Selectist<T>' object  provided by MVC
                    - Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Rendering  
        - Create a ViewModel class

3. Sharing Data Across Controllers by Maintaining Data Out-of-The-Controller Object
    - Hosting Env. i.e. The  dotnet.exe will be responsible for storing thios data on sever
    - Two Ways
        - TempData
            - TempDataProvider object
            - Maintain the state untill the Target Controller is not reading data from TempData
            - Once the Target COntroller Reads the data from TempData, it will be cleaned from the TempData
            - This is recommended for Sharing data across 2 COntrollers
            - *** Once aan Action Method from Target Controller reads the data, its will be cleaned from TempData so other action methods of target controller will not be able to read data
                - TO make sure that the Data from TempData to be availble across all action method of Target Controller use 'TempData.Keep()' method explicitly  
        - Session State
